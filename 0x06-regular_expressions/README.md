- A regular expression, commonly called a “regexp”, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.
- It is mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching (i.e. it operates like a “find and replace” command).
- While it is a very powerful tool, it is also very dangerous because of its complexity.

#### I had a problem so I used regular expressions. Now I have two problem

- Regular expressions are everywhere and software engineers,
- no matter their positions, will have to use them during their careers.
- System administrators and DevOps are the ones using them the most because they are very handy for log parsing

#### Background Context
- For this project, you have to build your regular expression using Oniguruma,
- a regular expression library that which is used by Ruby by default.
- Note that other regular expression libraries sometimes have different properties.

- Because the focus of this exercise is to play with regular expressions (regex),
- here is the Ruby code that you should use, just replace the regexp part,
- meaning the code in between the //:.
